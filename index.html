    		<h2>Hi my name is Alan Bishop, welcome to my IGN Code Foo submission page! Please use the navigation bar on the left to 
    			check out the various projects in my submission and read on below for a little bit of background about me.</h2>
    		
    		
    		<h3>My Coding Background</h3>
    		<p>When I was 15 I took my first programming course at a community college as an elective, not knowing
    		what exactly to expect. I had always had an interest in programming, but when I took this course everything
    		seemed to click for me. This lead me on the path to a Computer Science degree that I am near completion of and
    		drove me to learn as much about programming and how computers work as possible. The languages that I
    		have learned include:
    		<ul>
    			<li>C, C++ and Objective-C</li>
    			<li>Java</li>
    			<li>Python</li>
    			<li>SQL, including SQLite and MySQL</li>
    			<li>HTML/CSS</li>
    			<li>x86 Assembly</li>
    			<li>Prolog</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>To me, programming is a lot like solving a giant puzzle, where you draw out and design something and then
    		try to implement it using the tools that you have available. The whole process is fun for me, and it is what
    		keeps me working hard on completing my college degree. I am excited at the opportunity to work on real world projects,
    		especially if it means working at one of my favorite companies.
    		</p>
    		
    		<h3>My Interest in IGN</h3>
    		<p>As long as I can remember, IGN.com has been one of the sites I visit on a daily basis. IGN.com is one of my favorite
    		websites because it allows me to keep up on the news on all the latest video games that I am interested in, as well as information
    		on other types of media that I am interested in such as movies, TV shows and tech gear. The recent introduction of the IGN Pro League
    		e-sports division is something that I strongly support. Following e-sports has been one of my more recently acquired hobbies as a big fan of
    		Starcraft 2, and I try to catch IPL every time I have a chance.</p>
    		
    		<p>Obviously as a gamer IGN would be a dream work enviroment for me. I am not just someone who plays video games but also gets sucked into
    			the culture surrounding video games. I am a collector of JRPGs (still trying to complete my collection of every Square-Enix game) and I
    			love both old retro games and newer ones. In my spare time I've dabbled in working on soundtracks for independent games, as well as helping
    			my friends create video game fansites and other projects. I love to work on projects that support the general "gamer" community and so
    			IGN would be the perfect work environment for me.</p>
    		<p>To me, the Code Foo program is an opportunity to show off my abilities that I would not get elsewhere. My GPA is fairly average, and although 
    			I have applied to many internships, my resume is probably just sitting in a pile somewhere being ignored, while with this program, I am actually
    			judged based upon what I can do rather than if my resume is impressive or if I went to a highly-rated college. I believe that I would grow and learn
    			a lot more about my field working at IGN over the summer rather than staying at home working a retail job trying to pick up some coding skills on the side.</p>
    		
    		<h3>My Other Interests</h3>
    		<p>Aside from video games and programming, I also have a passion for music. I have been DJing and producing music since I was
    			14 and I have been running a mobile DJ business with my father and brother for the last 4 years. My favorite types of music
    			are electronic dance music genres, mainly Trance, House, Electro and Jungle, but also including more obscure genres like
    			Happy Hardcore and Goa Trance. While I am DJing, I think of ways that the music I am playing will effect the people around me
    			and how I can make them happy and get them dancing. If I'm playing to a large crowd or just making a mix for one of my friends,
    			it makes me happy to think that I can make a difference in their day.</p>
