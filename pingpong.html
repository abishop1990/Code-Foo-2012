    		<h2>"How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an average-sized school bus? 
    			Describe each step in your thought process."</h2>

<p>To solve this, the first thing I would think to do is to find the volume of the interior of the average school bus. 
	This requires a bit of research since this isn't common knowledge. 
	<a href ="http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/10000/10600/10694/MBTC1054-1.pdf">According to the BLS</a> a school bus has a width of 2.4 meters,
	a length of 11.1 meters and a height of 3.3 meters.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>These dimensions are of the interior (they're not but those dimensions are not easily identifiable, 
	and there are many factors which make this impossible to determine without much research and some advanced calculus).</li>
<li>The school bus is a rectangle, and we are considering a bus that does not have a rounded top.</li>
<li>All interior equipment is removed, there are no seats, steering wheels, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>Next, I would want to find the volume of a singular ping pong ball. This is pretty easy since 
	this is widely known information. According to the International Table Tennis Federation, a 
	standard ball is 40 mm in diameter. With this information, we must also assume that when placing 
	balls in, since they are round, they will only contact another ball in one place, the top or side, 
	thus we can assume that a ball has an effective volume of a cube. Therefore we have an effective ball volume of 
	64000 cubic-millimeters, a height of 40 mm, a width of 40 mm and a length of 40 mm.</p>

<p>For this I am going to use the dimensions to determine how many balls will fit into the bus rather 
than the volume. The reason for this is that you can't stack the balls any higher than the height, 
you can't stack the balls and longer than the length, etc. If the dimensions in ping-pong balls don't 
come to a roudn number, you must round down, because this is the limit to how many whole balls you can 
fit into the bus.</p>

<p>Height in “effective” ping-pong balls = 3.3 meters/40 mm (.04 meters) = 82.5 ping-pong balls</p>
<p>Length in “effective” ping-pong balls = 11.1 meters/40mm (.04 meters) =  277.5 ping-pong balls</p>
<p>Width in “effective” ping-pong balls = 2.4 meters/40mm (.04 meters) = 60 ping-pong balls.</p>

<p>Now we have a very simple volume equation for a rectangular box (height * length * width):</p>

<p>82 ping-pong-balls * 277 ping-pong balls * 60 ping-pong balls = 1362840</p>

<p><strong>So therefore the total number of ping-pong balls that would fit in the average 
	standardized school bus, based upon the above assumptions is 1,362,840.</strong></p>
