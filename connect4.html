		<h2>"Programmatically create a game of Connect 4™ with one AI-controlled opponent and a human-controlled player."</h2>

<p><strong>Note: Although I did not have time to finish the program, I did create a design doc for if I wanted to 
	implement it later.</strong></p>


<p>General Game Rules:
<ul>
<li>Connect 4 is a 7 slot wide, 6 slot high game</li>
<li>There are 2 players, one red, one black</li>
<li>Players take turns placing one in a slot until they have 4 adjacent pieces in a “row” either 
	horizontally, verically or diagonally</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Basic Structure of Program (Assume no AI for the moment):
<ul>
<li>Game board starts out empty</li>
<li>In a loop until game has been won or no more moves available:
	<ul>
	<li>Switch players (on first move this will set to player 1)</li>
	<li>Wait for current player to place a piece
		<ul>
		<li>If player clicks somewhere, check if it is a legal move, if so, a piece is placed</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>When game is over the game will prompt for another game
	<ul>
	<li>If yes restart game</li>
	<li>If no, exit program (or return to a title screen or do whatever)</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The GUI (Brainstorming, some of this may not be implemented):
<ul>
<li>Should start with a white background, a simple window with OS look-and-feel</li>
<li>Yellow box with circular holes</li>
<li>Current player's turn above in large text</li>
<li>Sidebar on right with new game and help buttons</li>
<li>When hovering above the game board, make the piece appear (only if it's the user's turn)</li>
<li>If the user clicks and they are above a column and it is legal they can move</li>
<li>Notification box for game-over, prompting user for a new game (or just an okay box)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Logic-side:</p>
<p>External loop
<ul>
	<li>Set board to empty</li>
	<li>Setup all game flags/boolean values to false</li>
	<li>Run main game loop</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Main game loop (Pure logic no GUI)
	<ul>
	<li>Get move</li>
	<li>Check for game over
	<ul>
		<li>If so break from game loop</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Change players</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Conditions for game over:
<ul>
	<li>Board is full (no moves available, draw)</li>
	<li>Player 1 or 2 wins
		<ul>
		<li>3 Possible ways: Diagonal, Vertical, Horizontal</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Making a move:
	<ul>
	<li>Validate move</li>
	<li>Place piece</li>
	<li>Check if the board is full, if so set a boolean value for draw</li>
	<li>Check if player wins, if so set a boolen value for player win</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>AI Design:
<ul>
<li>Search for best available move (based upon priority):
<ol>	
<li>If AI has 3 in a row, place fourth</li>
<li>If opponent has 3 in a row attempt to block
<ul>
<li>If there are multiple 3 in a row, then block first found</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If opponent has 2 in a row and 1 on other side, block it</li>
<li>Search for longest consecutive sequence of AI (1 or 2) and place</li>
<li>If AI has no sequence, place to block player's 2 in a row</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Issues with this method:
	<ul>
	<li>How can I set the AI to place 4 in a row on both sides? (with a hole to fill)</li>
	<li>How will AI keep track of diagonals and stacking strategy?</li>
	<li>Will this be competitive to user?</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
