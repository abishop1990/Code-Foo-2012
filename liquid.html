    	<h2>"Create a liquid layout with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This layout must support the following resolutions: 
    		1024x768, 1680x1050. Explain why you would use a liquid layout."</h2>
    		
    	<h3>What is a liquid layout?</h3>
    	<p>A liquid layout is a webpage that is formatted to automatically resize the content based upon the size of the browser.
    	This entire webpage has been designed with a liquid layout, using percentages for different sections of the pages, so to demonstrate
    	the functionality of a liquid layout, simply resize this page. Liquid layout designs are implemented by using percentage-based
    	 dimensions rather than pixel-based, so that everything takes up a certain percentage of the browser window.</p>
    	<h3>Why use a liquid layout?</h3>
    	<p>Liquid layouts are used in order to ensure that web pages will be viewable in different formats, such as on mobile 
    	devices and tablets and regular web browsers. All different types of resolutions should be supported under this format,
    	however there are certain constraints. If a page is resized too small there may be issues with content having undefined
    	behavior if the content cannot fit on the page. This is why fixed layouts are sometimes used, where a user would simply
    	have to scroll in order to view parts of the content off the page. It is really up to the personal preference of the web
    	designer as to what style of layout to use.</p>
    	<h3>How did I create this site?</h3>
    	<p>I created my website doing a liquid layout for the first time, since I had not done much web work in the past and the majority
    	of my coding experience had come in the form of more old-school C/C++ style programming. Using a couple of web resources for research,
    	I found it fairly easy to implement this website. I used div tags to section off my webpage, and then used CSS to define the various
    	attributes of each section. This gave me an opportunity to play around with a lot of HTML and CSS features that I had not used as much
    	before, and I learned a lot about both web design and web programming. </p>
    	<p>Some of the challenges that I encountered while designing this web site included font issues, making things work correctly on
    		all types of browsers (including on OS X, Windows and Android, but I did not have access to iOS to test it) and trying to design
    		a website that looked good. As a programmer, graphic design is one of my weaker suits, so it took me a while to come up with a 
    		page layout and make the content look attractive. Though I could have used some templates from the internet to start with, I prefered
    		to tinker with the web site and start complete from scratch. I used Aptana Studio to build my website, which I found to be a reliable
    		open source web IDE. I also received some feedback from friends, and used this information to improve my web site.</p>
